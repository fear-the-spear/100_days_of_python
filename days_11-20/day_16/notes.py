# Up to this point, we have been using proceedural programming
# to write our code. Proceedural Programming is the process of
# setting up proceedurs or functions that do particular things.
# For the most part, the code runs top to bottom and then jumps
# out into a function as needed.

# object-oriented programming is the combining of pieces of data (attributes)
#  and some functionality (methods)
# these objects are created using blueprints (classes)

# the virtual restaurant
# waiter - two things we need to think about:
#   1. what it has (attributes)
#   2. what it does (methods)

# an attribute is a variable that's associated with a modeled object
# a method is a function that a particular modeled object can do.
