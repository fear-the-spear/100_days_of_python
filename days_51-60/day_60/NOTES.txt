A Quick Note About Day 60:

For day 60, we are adding a working contact form to our website on day 59. So
instead of copying all the code over to here, I'm going to leave it on day 59 -
hopefully this note will make sense to anyone using this code for notes or
anything else.

EDIT:
A Flask project titled 'html-forms' has been added to this day's content. It
is a small project to demonstrate how to properly use and submit a form. This
info learned in this project will be applied to day 59's project.
