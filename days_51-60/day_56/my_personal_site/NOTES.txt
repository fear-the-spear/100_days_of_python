Flask is a framework, not a library. Because of this, it will put certain
restrictions and requirements on the code so that it will actually work.

- TEMPLATES
  · Templates need to be located in '[project-root]/templates/'
  · In order to use templates, the method 'render_template' must be imported
    from flask into the main project file (server.py, etc.)

- STATIC FILES
  · Static files like CSS, SASS, images, JavaScript, etc. are all to be placed
    in '[project-root]/static/'
