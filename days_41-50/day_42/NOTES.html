<!--This is what an HTML boilerplate looks like: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This tells the browser the file is HTML 5 code -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- the html tag is the root of the document - all other tags go inside -->
  <head>
    <!-- important information that is not displayed to the user -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- this is where all the content of the website belongs -->
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
