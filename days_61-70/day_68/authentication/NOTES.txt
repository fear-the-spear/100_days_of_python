Levels of Password Security

LEVEL 1
  - Simply storing a password as plain text in the database

LEVEL 2 - Encryption
  - A scrambling of the text
  - Requires key or cipher method to scramble and unscramble

LEVEL 3 - Hashing
  - Doesn't require a key
  - Uses a function to turn password into hash

LEVEL 4 - Salting
  - Generates a string of a certain length (a salt) and combines that
    string with the password before hashing
  - Can be salted by n rounds for extra security
