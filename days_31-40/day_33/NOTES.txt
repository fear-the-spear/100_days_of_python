NOTES on API's


- What is an API (Application Programming Interface)
  An API is a set of commands, functions, objects, and protocols that
    programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

  This means that live data can be pulled from certain websites
    and used within our own python programs.

  An API is an interface, or a barrier, between your program and
    an external system.

  Use the rules that the API has prescribed to make a request to the
    external system for some piece of data.

  If you have structured your request according to all of the requirements
    that this external system has set out in their API, they will respond to
    you appropriately and give you the data that you want.

  BUT, if you don't follow the rules, then your request will be invalid and
    they will tell you to go away.

- Some examples of websites that have their own API's
  Yahoo! Weather has their own weather API that can be tapped into to get
    10-day weather forecasts, wind, atmosphere & astronomy conditions.

  Coinbase has an API that let's you tap into the current live prices of crypto

  NBA also has an API for getting various stats and info on players, teams,
    coaches, leagues, historical and other advanced data.

- A Metaphor That Explains API's:
  Imagine the website as a restaurant and the data as the kitchen.
  As a member of the public, we can't just walk in and start raiding the
  cupboards. That's what the menu is for. The menu serves as a sort of interface
  between you and the resaurant. It's the thing that tells you what you can
  and can't order. This is exactly what an API is - a menu.
