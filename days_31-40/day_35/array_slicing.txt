Array Slicing

We have gone through this in previous lessons, but here's a refresher:

- Slicing
a[start:stop]         # items start through stop - 1
a[start:]             # items start through the rest of the way
a[:stop]              # items from the beginning through stop - 1
a[:]                  # a copy of the whole array

There is also the step `step` value, which can be used with any of the above:

- Step
a[start:stop:step]    # start through not past stop, by step
