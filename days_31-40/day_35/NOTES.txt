NOTES on API Keys, Authentication, Environment Variables, and Sending SMS

- API Keys
  Most APIs that provide simple information (like the sunrise and sunset API)
    are free of charge. However, there are tons of APIs out there that provide
    more valuable information. That information usually comes at a cost. But
    even the paid APIs will offer a free tier. That's where API keys come in.

  An API key is sort of like a personal account number and password for access
    to a certain API. This is how the API provider can track how much you are
    using their API, authorize your access, or deny your access once you have
    gone over the limit.
