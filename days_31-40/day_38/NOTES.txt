Bearer Authentication

- What is bearer authentication?
  Bearer authentication (also known as token authentication) is an HTTP
  authentication scheme that involves security tokens. The name "Bearer
  authentication" basically means "give access to the bearer of this token".
  The security token or "bearer token" is just a cryptic string. An example
  of a bearer token would be a string that could look something like this:

  "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLheAAAAAAA0%2BuSeid%2BULvsea
  4JtiGRiSDSJSI%3DEUifiRBkKG5E2XzMDjRfl76ZC9Ub0wnz4Xs
  NiRVBChTYbJcE3F"

  The idea is that whoever has the secret token has permission to interact
  with the data. A client - like a browser or mobile app - would then send
  this security token in the Authorization header when making requests to
  a server.
