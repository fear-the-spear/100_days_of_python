Today's Learning Points

  • Visualize data and create charts with Matplotlib

  • Pivot, group, and manipulate data with Pandas to get into desired format

  • Work with timestamps and time-series data

  • Style and customize a line chart to your liking

  • Use .groupby() to explore the number of posts and entries per programming language

  • Convert strings to Datetime objects with .to_datetime() for easier plotting

  • Reshape DataFrame by converting categories to columns using .pivot()

  • Use .count() and .isno().values.any() to look for NaN values in our DataFrame,
    which we then replace using .fillna()

  • Create (multiple) line charts using .plot() with a for-loop

  • Style our charts by changing the size, labels, and upper & lower bounds of our axis

  • Add a legend to tell lines apart (color-distinguished)

  • Smooth out our time-series observations with .rolling().mean() and
    plot them to better understand the data and identify trends over time
